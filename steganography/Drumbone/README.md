# Drumbone

## Description :

I joined a couple of hacking channels on IRC and I started recieving these strange messages. Someone sent me this image. Can you figure out if there's anything suspicous hidden in it?

## Resolution

Edit the image with the tool stegsolve ( http://www.caesum.com/handbook/Stegsolve.jar ) and navigate with the arrows in order to obtain an image with a pattern of QRCode

and after read the QRCode and you have the flag
